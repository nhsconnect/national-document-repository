# Welcome to the Access & Store contributors guide

Thank you for your interest in improving the codebase that powers the [Access and store digital patient documents](https://national-document-repository.nhs.uk/) website.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

To raise an issue, please contact one of the [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) directly, or raise a PR.

If you're new to GitHub and/or Markdown, GitHub's own [contributor's guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides good signposting on these topics.

## Pull requests and merging

You can't push to the main branch. Therefore, for all changes you will need to create a new branch, and then a pull request to merge said branch into `main`. The [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) will be nominated as reviewers of your PR by default, but feel free to add other people as well if you think they will have valuable input.

## Contributing guidelines and etiquette

- Preview your Markdown code to make sure the format is not broken.
- Check grammar, spelling and punctuation - no-one wants to look pedantic by requesting changes due to typos or inconsistent grammar/syntax, but it's only fair to keep this tidy.
- The codebase is open to the world. This has a few implications:
  - Nothing in it should be confidential, private to NHSE or include any personal data.
  - All links should be public.
  - Consider comments and README.md text: comments in open source repos such as this are not official communications and don't go through the normal approval process for public communication. They can however still be interpreted as official communication, even if not intended as such.
- Use [inclusive language](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/main/inclusive-language.md): avoid terms which cause hurt and offence, including if they have historically been considered industry-standard terms.
